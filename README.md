# Turn WebCam into an ip camera

In this repository there are two different methods to perform facial detection: using the Dlib library and using a haarcascade model. Detections with the haarcascade model are more inaccurate.
The file real_time.py can be executed in a camera.
The file static.py requires an image.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
python file.py
```

**In this repository there are two different methods to perform facial detection: using the Dlib library and using a haarcascade model. Detections with the haarcascade model are more inaccurate.**

Requirements:
 - Python with the modules OpenCV and Dlib.

The file real_time.py can be executed in a camera.
The file static.py requires an image.

To execute: python file.py
